## Hello, World! 👋

My name is Erin Tam, and I am currently a student at SAIT, studying Interactive Design with a major in Graphic Design. For a long time I have wanted to start programming, with a goal of learning to write clean and precise code.

🎓 I have a Bachelor degree on Fine Arts Visual Studies from the University of Calgary, specializing in creating immersive worlds through mixed mediums. I strive to transport audiences from the familiar into the surreal. By blending my artistic expertise with coding, I aim to produce innovative, standout work that combines creativity and technology.
