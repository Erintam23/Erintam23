## Hello, world! 👋

My name is Erin Tam, and I am currently a student at SAIT, studying Interactive Design with a major in Graphic Design. I am a beginner in JavaScript and GitHub, with a goal of learning to write clean and precise code. I hold a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from the University of Calgary. As a multidisciplinary artist 🎨, I strive to create worlds that transcend the one we live in. I love working with mixed mediums and love using art to tell stories to transport the audience from the logical and familiar into a more surreal space. By blending my expertise in art and coding, I aspire to produce work that truly stands out ⚡.
